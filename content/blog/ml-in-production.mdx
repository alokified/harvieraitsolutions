## The Challenge of Production ML

Moving machine learning models from Jupyter notebooks to production systems is one of the biggest challenges data science teams face. The gap between a working prototype and a production system is significant.

## Key Challenges

### 1. Data Quality and Drift

Production data rarely matches your training data perfectly. Models degrade over time as data distributions change.

### 2. Scalability

A model that works on a sample dataset may struggle with production volumes.

### 3. Monitoring

Unlike traditional software, ML systems can fail silently, producing incorrect predictions without errors.

## MLOps Best Practices

### Version Everything

- **Code**: Git for source control
- **Data**: DVC or similar tools
- **Models**: Model registries like MLflow
- **Experiments**: Track all experiments with their hyperparameters

### Automate Training Pipelines

Create reproducible training pipelines that can be triggered automatically:

```python
# Example training pipeline
def training_pipeline():
    data = load_and_validate_data()
    features = engineer_features(data)
    model = train_model(features)
    metrics = evaluate_model(model)
    if metrics['accuracy'] > threshold:
        deploy_model(model)
```

### Implement Monitoring

Monitor more than just infrastructure metrics:

- **Model Performance**: Track accuracy, precision, recall over time
- **Data Quality**: Validate input data characteristics
- **Prediction Distribution**: Detect distribution shifts
- **Business Metrics**: Measure impact on actual business KPIs

### A/B Testing

Always deploy new models alongside existing ones and compare performance before full rollout.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Training-serving skew**: Differences in feature engineering between training and serving
2. **Ignoring latency**: Models that are too slow for real-time use cases
3. **Lack of fallback**: No graceful degradation when models fail
4. **Missing retraining strategy**: Models become stale without regular updates

## Conclusion

Successful ML in production requires more than great models. It demands robust engineering practices, continuous monitoring, and a strong MLOps culture.
