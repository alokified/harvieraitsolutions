## What is Zero Trust?

Zero trust is a security framework that requires all users, whether inside or outside the organization's network, to be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated before being granted access to applications and data.

## Core Principles

### 1. Verify Explicitly

Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points, including user identity, location, device health, service or workload, data classification, and anomalies.

### 2. Use Least Privilege Access

Limit user access with just-in-time and just-enough-access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection to secure both data and productivity.

### 3. Assume Breach

Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to gain visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Identify your protect surface**: Determine what needs protection
2. **Map the transaction flows**: Understand how data moves
3. **Architect your network**: Design for zero trust
4. **Create policies**: Define access rules
5. **Monitor and maintain**: Continuous improvement

## Tools and Technologies

- **Identity Providers**: Okta, Auth0, Azure AD
- **Network Security**: Cloudflare, Zscaler
- **Access Management**: HashiCorp Vault, AWS IAM
- **Monitoring**: Splunk, Datadog, ELK Stack

## Conclusion

Zero trust is not a product but a strategy. It requires a cultural shift and ongoing commitment to security best practices.
