## Introduction

Cloud-native architecture has evolved significantly in recent years. As we move into 2025, new paradigms are emerging that promise to further transform how we build and deploy applications.

## Key Trends

### 1. Serverless-First Development

Serverless computing has matured beyond simple functions. We're seeing entire applications built on serverless architectures, with frameworks that make it easier than ever.

### 2. Edge Computing Integration

Processing data closer to the source is becoming critical for latency-sensitive applications. Edge computing platforms are being integrated into cloud-native stacks.

### 3. Platform Engineering

The rise of internal developer platforms (IDPs) is changing how teams interact with cloud infrastructure. Platform engineering is becoming a distinct discipline.

## Best Practices

- **Start with containers**: Even if you're going serverless, understanding containers is essential
- **Embrace Infrastructure as Code**: Treat your infrastructure like application code
- **Implement observability from day one**: You can't manage what you can't measure
- **Design for failure**: Build resilient systems that gracefully handle failures

## Conclusion

Cloud-native architecture continues to evolve, but the core principles remain: scalability, resilience, and agility. By staying current with these trends, you can build systems that stand the test of time.
