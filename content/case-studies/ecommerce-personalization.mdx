challenge: An online retailer was experiencing low conversion rates and high cart abandonment. Their generic product recommendations weren't resonating with customers, and they were losing market share to competitors with better personalization. The rule-based recommendation system couldn't adapt to individual preferences or seasonal trends.
solution: We built an AI-powered personalization engine using machine learning to deliver real-time product recommendations, personalized emails, and dynamic pricing strategies. The system unified customer data from multiple touchpoints and used collaborative filtering and deep learning models to predict customer preferences.
impact: The personalization engine transformed the customer experience, showing each shopper products they're most likely to purchase. The system processes over 10 million recommendations daily and continuously learns from customer behavior to improve accuracy. This resulted in $12M in additional annual revenue and significantly improved customer engagement metrics.

2. **ML Models**: Developed collaborative filtering and deep learning models
3. **Real-time Processing**: Built streaming pipeline for instant recommendations
4. **A/B Testing**: Continuous optimization through experimentation

## Business Impact

The personalization engine transformed the customer experience, showing each shopper products they're most likely to purchase. The system processes over 10 million recommendations daily and continuously learns from customer behavior to improve accuracy.
