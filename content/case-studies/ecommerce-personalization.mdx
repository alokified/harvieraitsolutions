## Project Overview

RetailMax Corporation needed to improve their online shopping experience to compete with major e-commerce players. Their existing recommendation engine was rule-based and couldn't adapt to individual customer preferences.

## Our Solution

We implemented a sophisticated ML-driven personalization system:

1. **Data Collection**: Unified customer data from multiple touchpoints
2. **ML Models**: Developed collaborative filtering and deep learning models
3. **Real-time Processing**: Built streaming pipeline for instant recommendations
4. **A/B Testing**: Continuous optimization through experimentation

## Business Impact

The personalization engine transformed the customer experience, showing each shopper products they're most likely to purchase. The system processes over 10 million recommendations daily and continuously learns from customer behavior to improve accuracy.
