## Project Overview

Global Financial Services Corp needed to modernize their 20-year-old banking infrastructure to compete in the digital age. The legacy mainframe systems were expensive to maintain, difficult to integrate with modern services, and couldn't support the real-time experiences customers expected.

## Our Approach

We implemented a phased migration strategy:

1. **Assessment**: Analyzed existing systems and identified migration priorities
2. **Architecture**: Designed cloud-native microservices architecture
3. **Migration**: Gradual migration with zero downtime
4. **Optimization**: Performance tuning and cost optimization

## Results & Impact

The transformation enabled the bank to launch new digital services 3x faster, onboard fintech partners seamlessly, and reduce their IT infrastructure costs significantly. Customer satisfaction improved dramatically with instant account updates and faster loan approvals.
