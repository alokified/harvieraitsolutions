## Project Overview

HealthCare Network Inc needed to quickly launch a telehealth solution to continue serving patients remotely. The platform had to be HIPAA-compliant, integrate with their existing EHR system, and scale to handle thousands of concurrent video consultations.

## Our Solution

We built a comprehensive telemedicine platform featuring:

- **Video Consultations**: High-quality, secure video calls
- **E-Prescriptions**: Digital prescription management
- **EHR Integration**: Seamless integration with existing systems
- **Patient Portal**: User-friendly mobile and web apps

## Impact

The platform enabled the healthcare network to maintain continuity of care during the pandemic and has become a permanent part of their service offering. Patients appreciate the convenience, and physicians can see more patients per day.
